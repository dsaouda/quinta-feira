# Quinta-Feira

Veja a versão em português ()

Quinta-Feira (Thursday) is a very simple WhatsApp bot I made to play with auto-responders on my birthday.

### But why (Quinta-Feira) Thursday?
The idea of ​​the name is to play with Tony Stark's artificial intelligence name, F.R.I.D.A.Y.

thursday was the day i put the bot to reply to automatic messages (my birthday) hehehe.

Also I wanted to convey the idea of ​​evolution, like the bot is not very good, but when it "evolves" to Friday it will be better. Hehehe

## Settings

Copy the `.env.sample` file and paste it with the name `.env`, open the file and make the settings.

## How to run?

Install the latest version of node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then access the project directory via the command line and then type:

`npm install`

Once this is done, just run:

`node thursday.js help` to see available options or to run the bot run `node thursday.js bot`

The browser will open, so I scanned the qrcode and enjoy :)

## Observation / Attention!!!

This program uses browser automation to interact with WhatsApp. WhatsApp has a history of blocking the phone when detecting use of unofficial apis. In this case, we are automating the browser, which is an official WhatsApp program, I don't know if that hurts its use rights, so use this program at your own risk.
